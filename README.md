# 📊 How Netflix’s Content Strategy Has Changed Over Time

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** analyzing Netflix’s movies and TV shows to understand how the platform’s **content strategy has evolved over time**. The analysis focuses on content growth, audience maturity, format strategy, and global distribution using Netflix’s publicly available dataset.

This was my **first project using Power BI**, created as part of an academic assignment, with an emphasis on correct data handling, meaningful visualizations, and clear storytelling rather than advanced features.
